# Movie-Search-App

This app uses JSON data from the Open Movie Database API (OMDb API) to display movie titles based on what a user queries. This is the same database IMDB.com uses for their website.

This exercise was one of my early experiences using express.js, node.js, and APIs to develop an interactive web application.
