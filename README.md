# Movie-Search-App

This app uses JSON data from the Open Movie Database API (OMDb API) to display movie titles based on a user's query. This is the same database IMDB.com uses for their website to display all of the movie content on their site..

This exercise was one of my first experiences using express.js, node.js, and APIs to develop an interactive web application.
